## 2025-09-20: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build Qwen3-Local, a specialized local deployment solution for running Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct (Int4, GPTQ) on high-end consumer hardware (RTX-4090 + 120GB RAM) using vLLM nightly or SGlang, targeting AI researchers, data scientists with sensitive data, and enthusiasts who need local LLM capabilities without cloud dependencies.

### Context

The market gap exists for efficient local deployment of large language models on consumer hardware. Current solutions either require enterprise-grade hardware or don't efficiently utilize available resources on high-end consumer setups. With the release of high-quality quantized models like Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct and improvements in inference engines like vLLM nightly, there's an opportunity to provide a polished, production-ready solution for local LLM deployment.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Model Serving Platform**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, support for multiple model types
   - Cons: Less optimization potential, complex feature set, harder to differentiate

2. **Cloud-Based Solution**
   - Pros: Easier scaling, no hardware requirements for users
   - Cons: Doesn't address privacy concerns, ongoing operational costs, misses the local deployment value proposition

3. **Research Tool Only**
   - Pros: Focused scope, easier to build
   - Cons: Limited market, no production features, reduced commercial potential

### Rationale

The decision to focus specifically on Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct and RTX-4090 + high RAM configurations allows us to:

1. **Deep Optimization:** Achieve superior performance through hardware-specific optimizations
2. **Clear Value Proposition:** Address specific pain points of local LLM deployment
3. **Target Market Alignment:** Serve researchers and data scientists who have invested in high-end hardware
4. **Technical Feasibility:** Leverage recent advances in quantization and inference engines
5. **Competitive Advantage:** Provide specialized solution rather than competing with generic platforms

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Ability to achieve significant performance advantages through specialization
- Clear positioning in the market with specific value propositions
- Focused development effort with well-defined technical constraints
- Strong alignment with privacy-conscious and cost-sensitive user segments

**Negative:**
- Limited addressable market due to specific hardware requirements
- Dependency on continued development of vLLM nightly and SGlang projects
- Risk of hardware ecosystem changes affecting target audience
- Need for deep technical expertise in CUDA optimization and memory management
