> Spec: BitsAndBytes 4-bit Quantization Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement BitsAndBytes 4-bit quantization using unsloth/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit with MoE-aware hybrid GPU/CPU execution for optimal performance. This implementation leverages the model's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to strategically place non-expert components and frequently used experts in VRAM while offloading remaining experts to system RAM, achieving 8-12 tokens/second on RTX-4090 (16GB) with 100GB DDR5 RAM.

## User Stories

### MoE-Aware Memory-Efficient Model Loading

As a developer, I want to load the Qwen3 80B MoE model with intelligent expert placement, so that critical non-expert components and frequently used experts reside in VRAM while remaining experts utilize system RAM efficiently.

The system will implement custom device mapping that places embeddings, attention layers, routers, and top-K most used experts in VRAM (using ~14GB), while seamlessly offloading remaining experts to CPU RAM with dynamic caching based on usage patterns.

### High-Performance Long Context Processing

As a user, I want to process long context inputs efficiently, so that I can leverage the model's 262K token context window without running into memory limitations or slow inference times.

The BitsAndBytes implementation will provide 10x inference throughput improvements for contexts longer than 32K tokens compared to standard implementations.

### Transformers-Native Integration

As a developer, I want to use the HuggingFace transformers ecosystem directly, so that I can benefit from native compatibility with tokenizers, generation utilities, and the broader transformers toolchain without requiring external inference engines.

## Spec Scope

1. **MoE-Aware BitsAndBytes Setup** - Configure custom device mapping for non-experts (VRAM) and experts (CPU RAM) with the unsloth model
2. **Expert Placement Optimization** - Implement profiling to identify and cache frequently used experts in VRAM
3. **Hybrid Memory Management** - Utilize 14GB VRAM for critical components and 90GB system RAM for expert storage
4. **Dynamic Expert Caching** - Create expert usage tracking and runtime optimization for expert placement
5. **Transformers Integration** - Direct transformers-based inference with MoE-aware optimizations
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Track expert activation patterns and memory utilization across GPU/CPU

## Out of Scope

- vLLM integration (BitsAndBytes quantization works differently and requires transformers-native approach)
- Custom UI development (focus on backend inference capabilities)
- Model fine-tuning or training (specification covers inference only)
- Alternative quantization methods (AWQ, GPTQ) in this implementation
- Multi-GPU distributed inference setup

## Expected Deliverable

1. MoE-optimized BitsAndBytes 4-bit model with custom device mapping for hybrid GPU/CPU execution
2. Expert profiling system identifying and caching top-K frequently used experts in VRAM
3. Performance achievement of 8-12 tokens/second on RTX-4090 (16GB) + 100GB DDR5 RAM
4. API endpoints with expert-aware inference optimization
5. Runtime expert management system with adaptive loading based on input patterns
6. Comprehensive monitoring of expert usage, memory distribution, and inference performance
7. Documentation of optimal expert placement strategies and performance benchmarks
