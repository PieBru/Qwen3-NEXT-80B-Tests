# BitsAndBytes 4-bit Implementation - Lite Summary

Implement BitsAndBytes 4-bit quantization with MoE-aware hybrid GPU/CPU execution, placing non-expert components in VRAM and experts in system RAM for 8-12 tokens/second performance on RTX-4090 (16GB) + 100GB DDR5.

## Key Points
- MoE-optimized device mapping: non-experts in VRAM, experts in CPU RAM
- Expert profiling and caching of frequently used experts in VRAM
- Hybrid execution using 14GB VRAM + 90GB system RAM efficiently
- Target performance: 8-12 tokens/second with dynamic expert management
