# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-20-performance-poc/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Model Configuration
- Model: Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct
- Quantization: GPTQ Int4 for memory efficiency
- Target Performance: >5 tokens/second sustained inference
- Memory Constraint: 16GB VRAM + 120GB system RAM maximum

### Inference Engine Selection
- Primary: vLLM nightly build (latest features for 80B models)
- Fallback: SGlang if vLLM has compatibility issues
- GPU Backend: CUDA with memory optimization flags
- CPU Offloading: Utilize system RAM for layers that don't fit in VRAM

### Memory Management Strategy
- GPU Memory: Optimize VRAM usage with tensor parallel processing
- System Memory: Use for KV cache overflow and model layer offloading
- Batch Size: Start with 1, optimize based on memory headroom
- Sequence Length: Test with 2048, 4096, and 8192 token contexts

### Performance Optimization Techniques
- Attention Backend: Use FlashAttention-2 for memory efficiency
- KV Cache: Implement dynamic allocation with system memory spillover
- Model Sharding: Split model across GPU and CPU memory boundaries
- Compilation: Use torch.compile for inference optimization where supported

### Benchmarking Methodology
- Warmup: 10 inference runs before measurement
- Test Prompts: Variety of lengths (50, 200, 500, 1000 tokens)
- Output Lengths: Fixed 100, 500, 1000 token generations
- Metrics: Tokens/second, memory usage, latency percentiles
- Environment: Isolated process, consistent GPU clocks

### Hardware Utilization
- GPU: Monitor VRAM usage, compute utilization, memory bandwidth
- CPU: Track system memory usage, CPU utilization during offloading
- Storage: SSD space for model caching and swap if needed
- Network: Local inference only, no external dependencies
