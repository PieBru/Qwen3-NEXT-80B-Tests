# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Qwen3-Next-80B Performance PoC
> Created: 2025-09-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the feasibility of running Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct locally with >5 tokens/second performance on available hardware (16GB VRAM + 120GB RAM). This PoC will validate technical approach and performance metrics for stakeholder approval.

## User Stories

### Performance Validation

As a technical stakeholder, I want to see concrete proof that Qwen3-Next-80B can achieve >5 tokens/second inference speed locally, so that I can approve moving forward with this model for production planning.

The stakeholder needs to see actual benchmark results running on our target hardware configuration, demonstrating that the 80B model is viable for our use case rather than falling back to smaller models.

### Technical Feasibility

As a development team lead, I want to understand the technical requirements and constraints of deploying this model, so that I can plan resource allocation and infrastructure needs.

This includes understanding memory usage patterns, optimization techniques required, and any hardware limitations that might impact deployment decisions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Model Deployment** - Successfully load and run Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct using GPTQ Int4 quantization
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Achieve and measure >5 tokens/second inference speed consistently
3. **Memory Management** - Optimize memory usage across 16GB VRAM and 120GB system RAM
4. **API Interface** - Create basic inference endpoint for testing and demonstration
5. **Metrics Collection** - Implement performance monitoring and reporting

## Out of Scope

- Production-grade error handling and logging
- User interface or web frontend
- Multi-user concurrent access
- Model fine-tuning or training capabilities
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Authentication and authorization
- Deployment automation and CI/CD

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working local inference server achieving >5 tokens/second with Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct
2. Performance benchmark results documenting token generation speed under various conditions
3. Memory usage analysis showing optimal configuration for available hardware
4. Simple API endpoint demonstrating model functionality with test prompts
5. Documentation of optimization techniques and configuration parameters used
