> Spec: AWQ Model Migration
> Created: 2025-09-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate from GPTQ to AWQ quantization for improved inference performance using the cpatonn/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-AWQ-4bit model. This migration will leverage AWQ's superior performance characteristics to achieve better token generation speeds while maintaining model quality.

## User Stories

### Performance-Critical Inference

As a developer, I want to migrate from GPTQ to AWQ quantization, so that I can achieve significantly improved inference performance (target >5 tok/sec) while maintaining the same model capabilities.

The current GPTQ setup provides adequate functionality but AWQ quantization offers superior performance characteristics for production inference workloads. The migration will involve updating the vLLM installation, reconfiguring model loading parameters, and validating performance improvements.

### Resource-Optimized Deployment

As a system administrator, I want to optimize memory usage for the AWQ model, so that I can efficiently utilize our 16GB VRAM + 120GB RAM configuration with tensor parallel processing.

This involves configuring tensor parallel size 4 to distribute the model across multiple GPUs while ensuring optimal memory allocation and performance scaling.

## Spec Scope

1. **vLLM AWQ Installation** - Install vLLM with AWQ support using the precompiled build
2. **Model Configuration** - Configure Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-AWQ-4bit with optimal parameters
3. **Tensor Parallel Setup** - Implement tensor parallel size 4 for distributed inference
4. **Memory Optimization** - Configure memory settings for 16GB VRAM + 120GB RAM environment
5. **Performance Validation** - Verify >5 tok/sec performance improvement over GPTQ

## Out of Scope

- UI changes or interface modifications
- Monitoring and logging features
- Model fine-tuning or customization
- API authentication or security enhancements
- Deployment automation or CI/CD integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working AWQ model deployment achieving >5 tok/sec token generation performance
2. Properly configured vLLM server with tensor parallel processing
3. Memory-optimized configuration for available hardware resources
4. Validated API endpoints with consistent response format
5. Performance benchmarks comparing AWQ vs GPTQ quantization
