# Model Loading Status

## Current Status
The model loading has been partially fixed but still faces challenges:
- ✅ Device mapping errors resolved
- ⚠️ CUDA OOM can still occur with default settings
- ⏳ Loading is slow (10-15 minutes, CPU-bound)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Device Mapping Errors
**Problem:** "model.layers.0.linear_attn.A_log doesn't have any device set"

**Solution:**
- Corrected the model configuration parameters (48 layers, 512 experts)
- Added proper device mapping for linear attention components
- Switched to "auto" device mapping for reliability

### 2. CPU Offloading
**Problem:** "Make sure you have enough GPU RAM to fit the quantized model"

**Solution:**
- Modified the model's config.json to enable CPU offloading
- Set `llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload: true`

### 3. Configuration Mismatches
**Problem:** Model has 48 layers but config specified 80

**Solution:**
- Updated config.py with correct values from model's config.json
- Fixed expert count (512 not 64)

## Current Loading Behavior

The model loads in two main phases:

### Phase 1: Checkpoint Loading (3-5 minutes)
- **What**: Loading 9 checkpoint shards from disk
- **Performance**: Single-threaded, CPU-bound (safetensors limitation)
- **Progress**: Shows "Loading checkpoint shards: X/9"

### Phase 2: Model Dispatch/Initialization (3-5 minutes)
- **What**: Setting up model on devices, initializing layers
- **Performance**: Multi-threaded, uses all CPU cores
- **Progress**: Now shows spinner with CPU/RAM usage

### Memory Management
- **Device mapping**: Using "balanced" to avoid meta tensor issues
- **VRAM limit**: 8GB to prevent OOM
- **RAM usage**: ~90GB for expert weights

## ⚠️ Model Caching Status

**Note: Caching is currently DISABLED for pre-quantized BitsAndBytes models**

The model caching feature has been disabled due to incompatibility with pre-quantized weights.
When attempting to cache, calling `model.state_dict()` on quantized weights causes:
```
RuntimeError: Tensor.item() cannot be called on meta tensors
```

This is a known limitation of BitsAndBytes quantized models where the weight tensors
cannot be properly serialized. The model will need to be loaded from scratch each time
(8-10 minutes).

## Performance Optimizations Needed

To speed up loading:
1. Install flash-linear-attention (optional, complex build)
2. Install causal-conv1d (optional, complex build)
3. Use SSD instead of HDD for model storage
4. Ensure model files are cached in RAM

## How to Test

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Check GPU memory is free first!
nvidia-smi

# Kill any Python processes using GPU if needed
# Look for python processes in nvidia-smi output

# Start the server (be patient, it takes 10-15 minutes to load)
./run.sh serve

# Monitor loading progress in another terminal
tail -f server.log
# Look for "Loading checkpoint shards: X/9" messages
# Each shard takes ~100 seconds
```

## Memory Requirements Confirmed
- RAM: ~90GB for expert weights
- VRAM: ~14GB for non-expert components
- The system correctly allocates memory as designed

## Next Steps
1. Wait for full model load to complete (10-15 minutes)
2. Test inference once loaded
3. Optimize with caching for faster subsequent loads
