# FP8 Model with vLLM Test Results

## Summary

✅ **vLLM 0.10.2 successfully installed with Qwen3-Next support**
❌ **FP8 model too large for RTX 4090 (16GB VRAM)**

## Test Environment

- **vLLM Version**: 0.10.2
- **Model**: Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct (FP8 quantized)
- **Model Path**: `models/qwen3-80b-fp8/`
- **Quantization**: compressed-tensors (FP8)
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (16GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 128GB DDR5

## Key Findings

### 1. vLLM Qwen3-Next Support
- vLLM 0.10.2+ supports `Qwen3NextForCausalLM` architecture ✅
- Model is correctly detected and recognized ✅
- Compressed tensors quantization is supported ✅
- Model successfully loads with proper configuration ✅

### 2. Model Loading Success
With aggressive memory settings, the FP8 model CAN be loaded:
- **Loading time**: 57.69 seconds for weights
- **Model size in VRAM**: 1.19 GB after compression
- **Available KV cache**: 11.94 GiB
- **Max tokens**: 122,368 tokens KV cache capacity

### 3. CPU Offloading Limitations
- vLLM 0.10.2 V1 engine has incompatibility with CPU offloading
- Error: "Cannot re-initialize the input batch when CPU weight offloading is enabled"
- Reference: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18298
- This is a known limitation affecting hybrid models (models with both attention and Mamba layers)

## Test Configurations Attempted

### Configuration 1: Standard FP8
```python
llm = LLM(
    model=model_path,
    quantization="compressed-tensors",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.85,
    max_model_len=2048,
)
```
**Result**: CUDA OOM

### Configuration 2: With CPU Offloading
```python
llm = LLM(
    model=model_path,
    quantization="compressed-tensors",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.5,
    cpu_offload_gb=90,
    max_model_len=1024,
)
```
**Result**: CPU offloading incompatibility error

### Configuration 3: Minimal GPU Memory
```python
llm = LLM(
    model=model_path,
    quantization="compressed-tensors",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.3,
    max_model_len=512,
)
```
**Result**: Still CUDA OOM

## Root Cause Analysis

The Qwen3-Next-80B model has 512 experts per MoE layer, which creates massive memory requirements even with FP8 quantization:
- Each expert needs memory allocation
- FusedMoE layer tries to allocate 1GB+ chunks
- Total model size exceeds available VRAM even at FP8 precision

## Recommendations

### 1. Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: 40GB+ VRAM (A100 40GB or better)
- **Recommended**: 80GB VRAM (A100 80GB or H100)
- Current RTX 4090 (16GB) is insufficient for this model size

### 2. Alternative Approaches
- **Use smaller Qwen models**: Qwen2.5-72B or smaller variants
- **Different quantization**: Try INT4 quantization instead of FP8
- **Model sharding**: Use tensor parallelism across multiple GPUs
- **Cloud deployment**: Use cloud GPUs with sufficient VRAM

### 3. Continue with BitsAndBytes
For the current hardware setup (RTX 4090 + 128GB RAM), the BitsAndBytes 4-bit implementation remains the viable option, despite slower performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Option A**: Acquire hardware with 40GB+ VRAM
2. **Option B**: Try INT4 quantization with vLLM
3. **Option C**: Optimize the existing BitsAndBytes implementation
4. **Option D**: Consider cloud deployment for production use

## Additional Tests Performed

### CPU-Only Execution
- **Attempted**: Running vLLM with CPU backend
- **Result**: Not supported - vLLM requires CUDA for initialization
- **Error**: "RuntimeError: No CUDA GPUs are available"
- **Limitation**: vLLM is fundamentally designed for GPU acceleration and doesn't support CPU-only mode

## Conclusion

vLLM 0.10.2 successfully supports Qwen3-Next models and can load the FP8 model with proper configuration. However, there are critical limitations:

1. **CPU offloading incompatible** with Qwen3-Next's hybrid architecture (V1 engine requirement)
2. **No CPU-only mode** - vLLM requires CUDA GPUs
3. **Memory constraints** - 512 experts need careful memory management

The model loads successfully (57 seconds, 1.19GB in VRAM) but cannot run inference due to the CPU offloading incompatibility. For the RTX 4090 setup, BitsAndBytes 4-bit implementation remains the only viable option until vLLM fixes CPU offloading for hybrid models.
