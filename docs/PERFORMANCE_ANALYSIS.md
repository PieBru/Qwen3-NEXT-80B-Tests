# Qwen3-80B MoE Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary
The Qwen3-80B MoE model is currently running at **0.12 tokens/second** instead of the expected **10+ tokens/second** due to CPU-only execution. This is a **~100x performance degradation**.

## Root Cause
**BitsAndBytes quantized models are incompatible with device_map**, forcing CPU-only execution:

1. The Unsloth pre-quantized model has meta tensors
2. Meta tensors crash when using `device_map` for GPU placement
3. To avoid crashes, the model runs entirely on CPU
4. CPU-only execution is ~100x slower than hybrid GPU/CPU

## Performance Metrics

### Current (CPU-only)
- **Speed**: 0.12 tokens/second
- **"2+2" inference**: ~16 seconds
- **CPU Usage**: 100% on all 32 cores
- **RAM Usage**: ~248GB
- **GPU Usage**: 0% (not utilized)

### Expected (Hybrid MoE)
- **Speed**: 10+ tokens/second
- **"2+2" inference**: <1 second
- **CPU Usage**: Moderate (expert loading)
- **RAM Usage**: ~90GB
- **GPU Usage**: ~10GB VRAM

## Architecture Mismatch

### Proper MoE Architecture
```
GPU (Fast, 10GB VRAM):
├── Embeddings (2GB)
├── Attention layers (4GB)
├── Routers/Gates (2GB)
├── Layer norms (1GB)
└── Output head (1GB)

CPU (Large memory, 90GB RAM):
└── 512 experts × 48 layers = 24,576 experts
```

### Current Implementation
```
GPU (Unused):
└── Nothing

CPU (Everything, causing bottleneck):
├── All embeddings
├── All attention
├── All routers
├── All experts
└── Everything else
```

## Why BitsAndBytes Fails with Device Mapping

When attempting hybrid placement with BitsAndBytes:
```python
device_map = create_moe_device_map()  # GPU for non-experts, CPU for experts
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "models/qwen3-80b-bnb",
    device_map=device_map  # FAILS with meta tensor errors
)
```

Error: `Cannot access 'item' on meta tensors`

## Solutions Attempted

### 1. ✗ Device Map with BitsAndBytes
**Result**: Meta tensor errors, crashes

### 2. ✗ Post-load GPU Migration
**Result**: Quantized weights incompatible with `.to(device)`

### 3. ✗ Manual Component Movement
**Result**: BitsAndBytes layers don't support device transfer

### 4. ⚠️ CPU-only (Current)
**Result**: Works but 100x slower

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Days)
1. **Accept current performance**: 0.12 tok/s is usable for testing
2. **Reduce max_tokens**: Keep generations short
3. **Cache common prompts**: Avoid regeneration

### Medium-term (Weeks)
1. **Try GPTQ quantization**: Better device_map support
2. **Use AWQ quantization**: Native MoE optimization
3. **Implement expert caching**: Keep hot experts in VRAM

### Long-term (Months)
1. **Wait for llama.cpp**: Optimal MoE support coming
2. **Use vLLM**: Production-grade MoE inference
3. **ExLlamaV2**: Supports hybrid execution

## Technical Details

### Why CPU is So Slow
- Matrix operations not optimized for CPU
- No SIMD/AVX acceleration for quantized ops
- Memory bandwidth limitations
- Cache misses with 40GB model

### Why GPU Would Be Fast
- Parallel matrix multiplication
- Optimized CUDA kernels
- High memory bandwidth
- Tensor cores for acceleration

## Conclusion

The performance issue is **fundamental** to BitsAndBytes quantization:
- BitsAndBytes doesn't support device_map properly
- Without device_map, can't do hybrid GPU/CPU
- Without hybrid execution, MoE runs 100x slower

**Current Status**: Model works but is impractically slow for production use.

**Recommendation**: Consider this a proof-of-concept. For production speeds, need different quantization method or wait for proper MoE support in inference frameworks.
