# vLLM Compatibility Issue with Qwen3-Next

## Problem

vLLM 0.6.6 does not support the `Qwen3NextForCausalLM` architecture used by the Qwen3-Next-80B model.

## Error Details

```
ValueError: Model architectures ['Qwen3NextForCausalLM'] are not supported for now.
```

### Supported Qwen Architectures in vLLM 0.6.6:
- `Qwen2ForCausalLM` ✅
- `Qwen2MoeForCausalLM` ✅
- `Qwen3NextForCausalLM` ❌ (Not supported)

## Root Cause

The Qwen3-Next architecture is newer than what vLLM 0.6.6 supports. The model uses:
- Linear attention layers (new in Qwen3-Next)
- Different attention patterns (linear vs full attention)
- Modified MoE architecture with 512 experts

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Wait for vLLM Update
- Monitor vLLM releases for Qwen3-Next support
- Check vLLM GitHub issues/PRs for progress

### 2. Use Alternative Inference Engines
- **Text Generation Inference (TGI)** by HuggingFace
- **DeepSpeed-MII** for MoE models
- **llama.cpp** (once Qwen3-Next support is added)

### 3. Continue with BitsAndBytes
- Current implementation works but is slow (0.12 tok/s)
- Could be optimized with better device mapping

### 4. Try Model Conversion
- Convert to a supported architecture (risky, may lose performance)
- Use model proxies or wrappers

## Current Status

✅ vLLM installed successfully
✅ Configuration created
❌ Model architecture not supported
❌ Cannot achieve target 10+ tok/s with vLLM

## Recommendation

For now, the best options are:
1. Continue optimizing the BitsAndBytes implementation
2. Try Text Generation Inference (TGI) as an alternative
3. Monitor vLLM for Qwen3-Next support updates

The FP8 model files are ready at `models/qwen3-80b-fp8/` for when support becomes available.
